I'm bearish on bitcoin ("**BTC**"). [1]

Bitcoin's appeals to its maximalists because of its scarcity. They call it **hard money** because its supply is limited. They believe that its scarcity ensures future **purchasing power**. In other words, they believe that bitcoin doesn't lose value with respect to the price of goods and services: Its value as an asset can never be inflated away because its supply is programmatically capped.

Maximalists are at best half correct. 

They definitely have the supply curve right. Bitcoin's fixed supply makes it a deflationary. However, they've missed the other influence on asset value (and thus purchasing power). They've not considered demand.

Economic value is the intersection of supply and demand. Bitcoin is **commodity money**. Like all commodities, it loses value when demand falls. Therefore, bitcoin's purchasing power is always a function of demand.

It's true that demand for bitcoin may skyrocket in the future. But present economic conditions must be a concern for a cryptocurrency that are purely a substitute for money.

## Current Economic Conditions

Yesterday the governor of the Bank of England sort of went to war with the pension fund industry. He explained that they have until Friday to clean up their acts.

He expressed those sentiments because the central bank had to *intervene* in the market for government bonds ("**guilts**"). Last week [guilts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gilts.asp) were selling *en masse*. So the Bank of England played market maker of last resort.

They purchased bonds.

When the central bank purchases guilts, they usually increase the supply of money. They do this indirectly. When they purchase government bonds, they buy so many that bond yields fall. 

Normally that's considered quantitative easing because it causes the sellers of those bonds to search for yield elsewhere. Scampering for yield, money trickles down to the broader economy.

When the Bank of England buys guilts, it's normally considered quantitative easing. Quantitative easing ("**QE**") is great for the cryptocurrency community. QE tends to push cryptocurrency prices higher. 

Last week's *intervention* wasn't technically quantitative easing. There's no cascade of money showering down on us plebs. Last week's bond buying commitment was purely to ensure that the market for guilts didn't collapse and result in a financial crisis.

Still... They purchased bonds.

The Bank of England expanded its balance sheet. That's what made Andrew Bailey so impatient with pension funds. The bank was forced to do the exact opposite of what he wanted it to do. He wanted to reduce the bank's balance sheet.

Banks everywhere want to reduce their balance sheets. The activity is called **quantitative tightening** ("**QT**") and most central banks are engaging in QT to combat rising inflation.

## Bitcoin is Broken

Technically, rising inflation is supposed to be a boon for Bitcoin maximalists. Their hoarding of BTC is supposed to result in skyrocketing bitcoin prices as investors seek shelter from inflation by acquiring the deflationary digital asset. At least, that was their theory.

If BTC were a true inflation hedge, it would act like a [flywheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K4W4hA6aV4) when inflation spikes. Unfortunately, that's not the case. And it will never be. 

Until BTC is used more frequently in economic or financial transactions, the demand for it as commodity money will remain lackluster. That's a tragedy for a digital commodity aspiring to outshine gold. 

Gold had luster as a commodity money because society actually used it to settle commercial transactions. That's the one thing the maximalists don't seem to understand.

## Backwardation Theory

[Bitcoin futures contracts](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.quotes.html) are in **normal backwardation** today and it's likely that they will continue to be tomorrow. Normal backwardation means that the price of the futures contract is lower than the spot price. [2]

This **term structure** expresses bearish sentiment. Meaning that market participants expect the price of bitcoin to drop by the end of term (i.e. October this year). They are selling the October contract. Whether their goal is to hedge or speculate, they want to buy Bitcoin at the lower price that they are anticipating.

Even if central banks resumed quantitative easing, backwardation would persist beyond October. Maximalists are bullish. However, the downward price trend is likely continue for an extended period because bitcoin is useless. 

**Contango** means that the futures price of bitcoin is higher than the spot price. Bitcoin futures were generally in contango in 2019.  Those were the *golden* days of bitcoin. The pun is intentional, but in all seriousness, bitcoin's mettle as an inflation hedge had never been tested.

Things are different now. The broken flywheel is no longer a secret. With banks everywhere tightening the supply of money and simultaneously raising interest rates, why would anyone want to hold bitcoin?

Bitcoin doesn't even earn interest.

The US dollar not only earns interest, but also appreciates given the present macroeconomic environment. The Federal Reserve System, the central bank of the United States of America, has declared ad infinitum that it will tighten until the economy breaks.

Even if the economy goes through the windshield, people aren't going to start using Bitcoin more when it does. 

The bitcoin futures market is still fairly **normal** but don't be misled. The market is considered "normal" when futures prices are higher at longer maturities. For example, the forward price of bitcoin in the March contract is higher than the forward price in the February contract in the graph below.

It would be abnormal for futures prices to be lower at longer maturities. The market is **inverted** when that happens. Indeed, the market is very slightly inverted between October 2022 and November 2022. Those forward prices indicate abnormality.

Futures markets will invert if there are supply shortages driving up the spot price (of crude oil for example). However, the futures market for bitcoin is immune to supply shortages. As previously established, the supply of bitcoin is essentially fixed.

## Conclusion

With the price of Bitcoin steadily falling over the last two months, and given the anticipated macroeconomic forecast, don't be surprised if the inversion becomes more pronounced.

Sell bitcoin futures to profit from backwardation and potential inversion. Better yet, use a bear call spread on options for October futures contracts to remove the risk associated with bitcoin's price fluctuation.

It's important to be incremental in sizing the short position. Fight. But be sure live to fight another day. This theory of persistent backwardation might not hold. Be prepared to be wrong.
